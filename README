This software is a web application. That mean it require few
software in order to work.

 - PHP version 5 (5.3 or greater recommended).
 - SQLite support (See official PHP Documentation http://www.php.net/manual/en/sqlite.setup.php).
 - JSON support (See official PHP Documentation http://www.php.net/manual/en/json.setup.php).
 - GD extension (See official PHP Documentation http://www.php.net/manual/en/image.setup.php).

/!\ /!\    WE ADVISE YOU TO USE APACHE AS WEB SERVER IN ORDER TO GET SECURE INSTALL    /!\ /!\

In fact, SQLite use files (*.sqlite) in your server to save databases.
To denie access to those files, we provide an '.htaccess' witch do it.
An other way, wheter you won't use apache, could be to configure your server/proxi to deni access to repository
witch store databases.

	SETUP :

	_ Extract the Snipeg archive in a repository on your server.
	_ Run install.php
	_ /!\ Remove install.php /!\


We hope that Snipeg will be usefull, without give any waranties.
